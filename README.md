# Overview

Experience a modern apartment in Virtual Reality. This is my first VR project that I have ever worked on. I have built this VR apartment for Google Cardboard as a part of my Udacity's Virtual Reality Nano Degree program. I have combined various ideas and skills that I have learnt during the course to build this  experience which include

1. Adding 3D models to the scene
2. Moving, scaling and rotating the 3D models
3. Deploying to Cardboard viewer
4. Creating materials and assigning textures
5. Creating animations and triggering them
6. Creating lights and baking them
7. Optimizing the scene for top performance
